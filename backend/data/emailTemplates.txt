Hi [COMPANY NAME],
My name is [NAME], and I am the [ROLE] for CU Hyperloop, a cutting-edge student team at the University of Colorado Boulder. Each year, we design and build an innovative 12-ft, 2,000-lb tunnel boring machine (TBM) to compete in The Boring Company’s Not-A-Boring Competition.

One of our biggest challenges (aside from digging tunnels) is actually getting our machine to Texas from Colorado. In past years, local businesses have played a crucial role in supporting our journey, and we’d love the opportunity to collaborate with you this year.
What’s in it for you? Partnering with CU Hyperloop offers your company brand exposure via social media, competition coverage, and logo placement on our machine and website, along with recognition at a global event attended by industry leaders.
